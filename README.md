## Getting Started 🚦
Clone this repository and run the following command:
```bash
git clone <>
```
If you're using [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), you can add the following line to your `.zshrc` file:
```bash
source <path-where-you-clone-it>/<type>/al_<name>.sh
# Or through a one-liner without the need of edit your .zshrc file separately
echo "source <path-where-you-clone-it>/<type>/al_<name>.sh" >> ~/.zshrc
```
If you're using [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), you can add the following line to your `.bashrc` file:
```bash
source <path-where-you-clone-it>/<type>/al_<name>.sh
# Or through a one-liner without the need of edit your .bashrc file separately
echo "source <path-where-you-clone-it>/<type>/al_<name>.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
```

## Tooling 🧑‍🔧

This template is equipped with an array of tools to maintain a high standard of code quality and accelerate the development process:

* [Precommit](https://pre-commit.com/) framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks
* [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/#/) is a simpler way to automate tasks
* [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) for managing build workflow
* [GolangCI-linter](https://golangci-lint.run/) for consolidated linting to improve code quality
* [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) for easy binary release management
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for containerization
* [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/) for shell script linting
* [Release please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) for automated releases
>**NOTE**: For pre-commit, ensure you're running `task pre-commmit-init` to add the pre-configured hooks into your `git` hooks. This will ensure that the code is linted and formatted before committing it. Also, there are other linters included (yaml, docker, shell, md, etc.).
